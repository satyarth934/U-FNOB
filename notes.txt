Downsampling
-------------

Original (full resolution) file size = 2.6MB/file
Downsampled (10m resolution) file size = 174KB/file

=> 11.3MB per simulation (assuming 65 years timeline)
=> 3.4GB for 300 simulations

# TODO: Right now the downsampled data has x and y coordinates as cartesian integer coordinates. Need to convert them back to the world coordinates.
